Instead of quiz questions or deeply interactive games like Kahoot and \'Jack\', respectively, Mostlikely.to is a simple game of allowing users to create their own questions and vote on which members of their lobby are most likely to do it. The project uses Socket.io web sockets to have live communication between the users and the server hosting the game and lobby. The frontend is then rendered using Vue.js to handle state management on the frontend so no user data is confused or lost for the client.","category":"web-development","tags":[{"name":"websockets"},{"name":"vue.js"},{"name":"web-dev"}],"link":"https://github.com/radroof22/Mostlikely.to","image":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23004551/120541624-19d94400-c3b8-11eb-87a6-cbddc8f94a96.png"},{"title":"Blockchain Drug Supply Chain","overview":"There were two main problems that this project hoped to address: temperature tracking and supply chain monitoring. The temperature tracking works by having the Raspberry Pi send updates, using its temperature sensor, to the blockchain to create a auditable record of the drug and to ensure it did not reach unbearable temperatures that would ruin the substance. Additionally, the supply chain monitoring works via RFID tags which, when they scan the RFID tag. The mobile app will scan the product and send a message to the blockchain updating its location accordingly to where it is currently","category":"web-development","tags":[{"name":"robotics"},{"name":"blockchain"},{"name":"ethereum"},{"name":"flutter"}],"link":"https://github.com/radroof22/blockchain-drug-supply-chain","image":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23004551/119529554-35a57000-bd50-11eb-8d65-658e80bc219c.jpg"},{"title":"Self-Driving Car","featured":true,"overview":"This project was created using a Tensorflow LSTM which would recieve images from the client robot and make predicition for which turns it should make.

Instead, a machine learning technique would allow the users to just need their phone to complete their assigned workouts and gain assistance from the model.","category":"machine-learning","tags":[{"name":"tensorflow"},{"name":"javascript"},{"name":"computer-vision"}],"link":"https://github.com/radroof22/PtAi","image":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23004551/119421930-d56dea00-bccd-11eb-9403-50926cb7993e.png"}]')}}]);
